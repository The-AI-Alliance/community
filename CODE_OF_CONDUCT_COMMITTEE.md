# Filing a Code of Conduct Violation Report

We take reports of violations to our project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with the utmost seriousness and will act upon them as quickly as possible.

To report a Code of Conduct violation to our Code of Conduct Committee, you may reach out to us via the contact form on the AI Alliance website (https://thealliance.ai) or use the email alias [contact@thealliance.ai](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in accordance with our Code of Conduct. Alliance leaders will respond to complaints in a way that is appropriate in the circumstances upon conclusion of a reasonable investigation.

As part of our follow up on your report, we would like to contact you for further discussion. If you would prefer not to engage beyond reporting the matter to the committee, please let us know that as part of your submission. We will respect your request.
