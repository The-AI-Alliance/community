## Introduction

Here are our guidelines for contributing a project that you think the Alliance might be interested in supporting or adopting. For information about making contributions to an existing project, see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page. The [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page is also where you can find information about project governance, code of conduct, acceptable open licenses, etc., which we won't repeat here.

An alternative is to [submit a use case](https://qmmqo.share.hsforms.com/2qlmffVx9R8iVNad39JmDPg) for your domain. Understanding domain-specific use cases help us determine optimal tools and architectures for those domains. Work with us on implementing your use case!

> **TODO:** We are revising our process for proposing projects for the Alliance. We will update this page accordingly. For now, if you are interested in proposing a project, [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/discussions).
