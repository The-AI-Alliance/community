# Contributing Projects to the AI Alliance

👍🎉 First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to AI Alliance initiatives! 🎉👍

This document describes our guidelines for contributing a  project that you think the Alliance might be interested in. For information about making contributions to an existing project, see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page. The [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page is also where you can find information about project governance, code of conduct, acceptable open licenses, etc., which we won't repeat here.

Feel free to propose changes to this document in a [pull request](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/pulls), [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/discussions), or [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai).

> **TODO:** We are revising our process for proposing projects for the Alliance. We will update this page accordingly. For now, if you are interested in proposing a project, [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai).
