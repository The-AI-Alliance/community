# Community Newsletter planning happens here:

* Subscribe to the AI Alliance Community Newsletter at the bottom of any [AI Alliance website](https://thealliance.ai/) web page. 
* Process: Copy this template to a new page at the beginning of the month (ex: March 1st). Add ideas to the page during the month. At the end of the month (March 31st), copy/paste the ideas into the [Community Newsletter Word Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wL-vp6mTulq2bqOq7xcH5rvy_axDU5U8Tq7e9bPTgAk/edit?usp=sharing). Use that document to continue to add/review/finalize the newsletter. Then copy/paste to Hubspot and send!
