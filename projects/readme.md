- [Ranking Safety Priorities](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ranking-safety-priorities/)
- [Trust & Safety Evaluations Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) (TSEI) - Seeks to create a hub that connects creators and consumers of evaluations in a sustainable value chain.
- Need: Identify which research institutes and Startups/SMBs to reach out to. Target 12 Fine tuning or application development. Creating benchmarks (taking commercially available models to tailor to their specific needs). And those who are looking for benchmarks. 
- Need from members: Help determining the requirements. And need to pitch the project to them
