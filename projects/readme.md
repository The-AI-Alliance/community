## Links to [Core Projects](https://thealliance.ai/core-projects) & [Affiliated Projects](https://thealliance.ai/affiliated-projects)
See [proposed projects here](proposed-projects.md)

### FA1 - Skills & Education
Topics: 
* Computer Science Programs - Are CS programs out of sync with industry needs?

### FA2 - Trust & Safety
Topics: AI risks can broadly be grouped into three categories:
* Security - threats to data integrity, privacy, system vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, identity theft, cyberattacks or misuse of AI-generated content.
* Ethical - Ethical risks involve bias, discrimination, transparency, and unfair decision making 
* Operational - Operational risks impact the reliability, efficiency, system failures, inaccurate predictions and lack of adaptability

Projects:
* [Trust & Safety User Guide](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-user-guide/)
* [Trust & Safety Evals](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/)
* [Ranking Safety Priorities](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ranking-safety-priorities/)
* [Trust & Safety Evaluations Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) (TSEI) - Seeks to create a hub of evaluations in a sustainable value chain.

Needs: 
* Need: Jonathan needs to identify which research institutes and Startups/SMBs to reach out to. Target 12 Fine tuning or application development. Creating benchmarks (taking commercially available models to tailor to their specific needs). And those who are looking for benchmarks. 
* Need from members: Help determining the requirements. And need to pitch the project to them 

### FA3 - Application & Tools
* [Open Trusted Data Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-trusted-data-initiative/) (ODTI)

### FA4 - Hardware Enablement
Topics: 
- Multi-architecture support
