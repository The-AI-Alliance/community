See [proposed project ideas here](project-ideas.md)

### FA1 - Skills & Education
Projects:
* [Guide to Essential Competencies for AI](https://thealliance.ai/core-projects/guide-to-essential-competencies-for-ai) - [eBook](https://thealliance.ai/docs/guide-to-essential-competencies-for-ai.pdf)

Topics: 
* Computer Science Programs - Are CS programs out of sync with industry needs?

### FA2 - Trust & Safety

Needs: 
* Jonathan needs to identify which research institutes and Startups/SMBs to reach out to. Target 12 Fine tuning or application development. Creating benchmarks (taking commercially available models to tailor to their specific needs). And those who are looking for benchmarks. 
* Jonathan needs members: Help determining the requirements. And need to pitch the project to them

Projects:
* [Trust & Safety User Guide](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-user-guide/)
* [Trust & Safety Evals](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/)
* [Ranking Safety Priorities](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ranking-safety-priorities/)
* [Trust & Safety Evaluations Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) (TSEI) ([intro slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11GdLAJ5BYUxpeQS2DLdOxZgLHhpZZdXX/edit#slide=id.p1) - Seeks to create a hub of evaluations in a sustainable value chain.

Topics: AI risks can broadly be grouped into three categories:
* Security - threats to data integrity, privacy, system vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, identity theft, cyberattacks or misuse of AI-generated content.
* Ethical - Ethical risks involve bias, discrimination, transparency, and unfair decision making 
* Operational - Operational risks impact the reliability, efficiency, system failures, inaccurate predictions and lack of adaptability

### FA3 - Application & Tools
* Application Patterns and Tools - Meets Every 2 weeks from 8am to 9am Pacific time
* [Open Trusted Data Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-trusted-data-initiative/) (ODTI)
* https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/applying-ai-guide/
