# AI Alliance Projects by Focus Area 
## [Core Projects](https://thealliance.ai/core-projects)

### FA1 - Skills & Education
Topics: 
* Computer Science Programs - Are CS programs out of sync with industry needs?

### FA2 - Trust & Safety
Topics: AI risks can broadly be grouped into three categories:
* Security - Security risks involve threats to data integrity, privacy, and system vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches or misuse of AI-generated content.
* Ethical - Ethical risks involve bias, discrimination, transparency, and accountability issues in AI decision-making.
* Operational - Operational risks impact the reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of AI systems in real-world tasks.

Projects:
- [Trust & Safety User Guide](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-user-guide/)
- [Trust & Safety Evals](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/)
- [Ranking Safety Priorities](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ranking-safety-priorities/)
- [Trust & Safety Evaluations Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) (TSEI) - Seeks to create a hub that connects creators and consumers of evaluations in a sustainable value chain.
- Need: Jonathan needs to identify which research institutes and Startups/SMBs to reach out to. Target 12 Fine tuning or application development. Creating benchmarks (taking commercially available models to tailor to their specific needs). And those who are looking for benchmarks. 
- Need from members: Help determining the requirements. And need to pitch the project to them 

### FA3 - Application & Tools
- [Open Trusted Data Initiative](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-trusted-data-initiative/) (ODTI)
##   [Affiliated Projects](https://thealliance.ai/affiliated-projects)

### Proposed:
- [Risk Atlas Nexus](https://github.com/IBM/risk-atlas-nexus)

### FA4 - Hardware Enablement
Topics: 
- Multi-architecture support
- Performance of the stack
- Layers in the stack, such as VLMM
