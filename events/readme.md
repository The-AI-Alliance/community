# AI Alliance Community Events & CFP List

This GitHub repo lists AI Alliance Community events (meet-ups, user groups, workshops, conferences, etc.) where our members are actively engaged (speaking, organizing, hosting, sponsoring, etc.). 

Want to contribute? Add an event, or offer a venue, or speak or sponsor.  By contributing to this repo, you can help conference organizers. Another goal of this [age is to create conferences for AI engineers, developers and researchers.
If they don't know your conference they can't buy a ticket and come to it üòè.

The Awesome AI Conferences list can be found here: https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/events/awesome-ai-conferences.md
