## Hyper Parameter Optimization for Computer Vision using TerraTorch


**Overview**

[TerraTorch](https://thealliance.ai/affiliated-projects/terratorch) is a fine-tuning and benchmarking toolkit for Geospatial Foundation Models built on PyTorch Lightning and tailored for satellite, weather, and climate data. It integrates domain-specific data modules, pre-defined tasks, and a modular model factory that pairs any backbone with diverse decoder heads. These components allow researchers and practitioners to fine-tune supported models in a no-code fashion by simply editing a training or inference configuration. By consolidating best practices for model development and incorporating the automated hyperparameter optimization extension Iterate, TerraTorch reduces the expertise and time required to fine-tune or benchmark models on new Earth Observation use cases. Furthermore, TerraTorch directly integrates with GEO-Bench, allowing for systematic and reproducible benchmarking of Geospatial Foundation Models. TerraTorch Iterate is not only driving GeoBench, but also Hyperparameter Optimizations (HPO) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). TerraTorch is open sourced under Apache 2.0, and can be installed via pip install terratorch from our Github repostitory.
