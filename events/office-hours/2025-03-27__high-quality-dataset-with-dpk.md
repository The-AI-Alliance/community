### Overview

When building machine learning and data applications, a significant portion of your time will be dedicated to data wrangling - from content extraction and filtering out problematic and low quality data. In this hands-on session we will explore Data Prep Kit - an open source toolkit, designed to streamline these essential tasks. Attendees will learn first hand how to use the Data Prep Kit to improve overall data quality such as removing spam and low quality documents, removing HAP (Hate Abuse Profanity) speech, removing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data, thus leading to higher quality dataset.

### Description

Join us for an interactive, hands-on session where you will learn to clean up data and prepare high quality datasets.

In this workshop we will do the following:

- Extract content from various documents (PDFs, HTML)
- cleanup and remove markups
- Detect and remove SPAM content
- Score and remove low-quality documents
- Identify and remove PII data
- Detect and remove HAP (Hate Abuse Profanity) speech from documents
- More about Data Prep Kit : https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit
