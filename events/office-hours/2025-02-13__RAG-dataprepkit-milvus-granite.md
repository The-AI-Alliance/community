## 2 - Workshop: RAG pipeline With Data Prep Kit + Milvus + Granite 

by Sujee Maniyam @ Node51

In this workshop we will do the following:

- Extract content from various documents (PDFs, DOCX, HTML) using Docling.
- Use Data Prep Kit to streamline data preparation including markup removal, de-duplication, remove problematic data like spam,  creating chunks and creating embeddings
- Vector Database Integration:  We will use Milvus - a popular open source vector DB,  to manage and search vectorized data effectively.
- And utilize an open source LLM like Meta-LLama or IBM-Granite to answer questions about documents
