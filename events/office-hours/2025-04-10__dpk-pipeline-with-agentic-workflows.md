## Simplifying DPK Pipeline Creation with Agentic Workflows

![](assets/data-prep-kit-1.png)


**Overview**

In this session, we present our experimental approach to creating DPK pipelines using agentic workflows. We will begin with a brief introduction to agentic workflows, followed by a walkthrough of two notebooks developed to support this work:

- The [first notebook](https://github.com/data-prep-kit/data-prep-kit/blob/dev/examples/agentic/Planning_DPK_agent.ipynb) shows a planner agent for Data-Prep-Kit tasks with code generation. The agent builds DPK pipeline that performs required tasks defined by a natural language.
- The [second notebook](https://github.com/data-prep-kit/data-prep-kit/blob/dev/examples/agentic/dpk_as_tools.ipynb) demonstrates how DPK transformers can be wrapped as tools within LangChain and LlamaIndex, along with examples of executing the transforms directly.

**Session Type:**  
Talk and Demo

**Audience**:  
LLM app developers, data scientists, data engineers

**Technical Level**:  
Beginner - Intermediate

**Prerequisites**:  
None

**Duration**  
45 mins
