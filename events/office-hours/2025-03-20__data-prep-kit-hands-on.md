## Workshop: Hands-on with Data Prep Kit

![](assets/data-prep-kit-1.png)


### Overview

When building machine learning and data applications, a significant portion of your time will be dedicated to data wrangling - from content extraction and cleaning to de-duplication and filtering out problematic data. In this hands-on session we will explore Data Prep Kit - an open source toolkit, designed to streamline these essential tasks. Attendees will learn first hand how to use the Data Prep Kit to accelerate data preparation, improve overall data quality, and enhance the efficiency of building robust LLM applications.

### Description

Data Prep Kit is a comprehensive Python library that democratizes and accelerates data preparation by providing out-of-the-box solutions for common tasks. Engineered to scale from a single laptop to large cloud clusters, it has been successfully used to process terabytes of data for training IBM Granite Large Language Models (LLMs).

Data Prep Kit offers a robust feature set including duplicate elimination, advanced document and code handling, language detection (for both spoken and programming languages), removal of personally identifiable information (PII), as well as spam, hate speech, and malware detection.
