## Speaker: Trevor Grant

Trevor Grant (IBM Research) is getting back into speaking after a hiatus from an otherwise prolific career that was put on pause during the pandemic. During his pause he became a father, published a book (Kubeflow for Machine Learning: From Lab to Production), had a second son, consulted for a while, went back to work for IBM Research, and became car free (this list is not ordered chronologically nor by significance). He has been putzing around generative AI since ~2017, and someday hopes to give a talk on his Star Trek Chat bots of 2018-2020. His primary open source interest at the moment is the qumat project of Apache Mahout and the gofannon project of the AI Alliance.
