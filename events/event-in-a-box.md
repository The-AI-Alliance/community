# Community-Event-in-a-Box
 
## Do you want to run an AI Alliance-affiliated event? 

We are building a global community. Events are a big part of how we reach people. Since our small team cannot organize and attend every conference and event, we rely on our members to take initiative. The following page outlines how we can best work together.

TYPES OF EVENT FORMATS
 
The AI Alliance has been involved in organizing, hosting, and sponsoring the following types of event formats:
 
* Meetups
* Workshops
* Unconferences
* Conference workshops/panels
* Happy hours / receptions
* VIP dinners

[Need help brainstorming your event ideas?](event-brainstorm.md)

WHAT’S THE PROCESS?
 
* Once you have your format, tell us about the event you’re planning.
* Using the checklists below, let us know which aspects you will handle and where you need help (logistics, funding, promotion, etc.)

## Steps to organize a community event
1. Find an organizer (another AI Alliance member?)
3. Join our Community Call to share your plans and get support. 
4. Find a speaker
5. Find a venue (paid venues often cost too much)
6. Find a date (check for conflicts)
7. Estimate attendance
8. Secure funding

1. Planning the Event


✅ 
✅ Decide on Frequency – One-time event or recurring meetup (monthly, quarterly)?
✅ Identify the Target Audience – Developers, AI engineers, business leaders, students, etc.
✅ Select a Date & Time – Avoid holidays and major conflicting events.

HOW DO WE DECIDE WHICH EVENTS TO SUPPORT
 
Events must align with the AI Alliance mission and support our community efforts, for example:
 
* Feature AI Alliance projects
* Bring AI Alliance member together in person
* Drive awareness vis-a-vis a particular group/community
* etc.
 
We will decide on a one-on-one basis which events we can support and which resources we can provide.
